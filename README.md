Subject: Urgent: Unfair Warning Due to Misunderstanding of Oath Certificate

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I am writing to formally express my concern regarding an unjust warning I received on November 8th. This warning stems from a misunderstanding related to the validity of my Oath Certificate for Spanish nationality.

On October 30th, after completing my public duty, I informed my team manager, Mr. Tristan Billot, about my absence, explaining that I had attended a legal and mandatory appointment to take my oath for Spanish nationality. I made it clear that this appointment was a valid justification for my absence and that I would provide the Oath Certificate (Acta de Jura) as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Mr. Billot initially dismissed its validity, stating, “They don’t care about your documents.”

Despite my repeated insistence and clarifications about the document’s importance, Mr. Billot did not acknowledge its validity until November 7th, when he formally requested it. I promptly provided the Oath Certificate on November 7th at 9:19 AM via email, before receiving the warning on November 8th. However, neither Mr. Billot nor his Senior Team Manager (STM) considered the document, which was a clear justification for my absence.

I also communicated the nature and importance of this appointment in advance via email and internal chat, making every effort to avoid misunderstandings. However, my explanations were not properly addressed.

It is important to note that I was unable to access my email or related documents easily due to restricted office conditions. Furthermore, there was a public holiday following my appointment, and I had a DNI appointment on November 4th, which limited my availability to respond in real-time. Despite these circumstances, I acted in good faith and provided the requested documentation promptly when asked.

I kindly request a thorough review of this situation. The warning issued against me is unjust and does not take into account the legal nature of my public duty or my compliance in providing the necessary documentation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to discussing this further to resolve this issue fairly.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]

Asunto: Urgente: Advertencia Injusta por Malentendido del Certificado de Jura

Estimado/a [Nombre del Destinatario]:

Me dirijo a usted para expresar formalmente mi preocupación con respecto a una advertencia injusta que recibí el 8 de noviembre. Dicha advertencia surge de un malentendido relacionado con la validez de mi Certificado de Jura de Nacionalidad Española.

El 30 de octubre, tras completar mi deber público, informé a mi jefe de equipo, el Sr. Tristan Billot, sobre mi ausencia, explicándole que asistí a una cita legal y obligatoria para jurar mi nacionalidad española. Dejé claro que esta cita era una justificación válida para mi ausencia y que proporcionaría el Certificado de Jura (Acta de Jura) tan pronto como fuera posible. Lamentablemente, el Sr. Billot desestimó inicialmente su validez, afirmando: “No les importa tu documentación.”

A pesar de mi insistencia y aclaraciones sobre la importancia del documento, el Sr. Billot no reconoció su validez hasta el 7 de noviembre, cuando lo solicitó formalmente. Proporcioné el Certificado de Jura el 7 de noviembre a las 9:19 AM por correo electrónico, antes de recibir la advertencia el 8 de noviembre. Sin embargo, ni el Sr. Billot ni su Gerente Senior (STM) consideraron el documento, que justificaba claramente mi ausencia.

Cabe destacar que comuniqué la naturaleza e importancia de esta cita con antelación por correo electrónico y chat interno, haciendo todo lo posible para evitar malentendidos. Sin embargo, mis explicaciones no fueron atendidas adecuadamente.

Es importante mencionar que, debido a condiciones restrictivas en la oficina, no pude acceder fácilmente a mis correos electrónicos o documentos relacionados. Además, hubo un día festivo después de mi cita, y el 4 de noviembre tuve una cita para el DNI, lo que limitó mi disponibilidad para responder en tiempo real. A pesar de estas circunstancias, actué de buena fe y proporcioné la documentación solicitada de manera oportuna cuando fue requerida.

Solicito respetuosamente una revisión exhaustiva de esta situación. La advertencia emitida en mi contra es injusta y no tiene en cuenta la naturaleza legal de mi deber público ni mi cumplimiento al proporcionar la documentación necesaria.

Gracias por su atención a este asunto. Quedo a la espera de discutir este tema para resolverlo de manera justa.

Atentamente,
[Tu Nombre Completo]

I need you to add the following key takes to restructure the email.
in the intruduction, make clear I got the warning because my tm trista bejot assured me that the document I wanted  to provide to justify my abacense was not valid for this mater, the document whas the oath certificaded for Spanish Nationality, 
after the introduction add.
in chronological order
I informed my tm thirstan Bejot about my public duty On Octobuer 30 five days before verbally On October 30 I let him know I need to leave my work post at 09:00 am since the   appointment was at 10:40ambefore I left I left a note in my verint record stating that I was leaving for the nationallity oath and then I will return, when I returned I also recorded in verint.
as soon as I returned, I let my tm Trista Bejot now that I did not get the 'justificante' but I had the oath certificate which I was sure it was valid enough to proof I went to the appointment that day at the appointment time, however   'they don't care about your documents they just want the justificante', then he suggeted me to 'call' the register office to request the justificante which no only i did but I went back to the register (registro civil  numero 2 de Barcelona) after I finish my shift at 03:30 when I requested the 'justificante' to which they told me the only solution was send an email to an email address they provided to me. which I did but I never got a replied.
given that after several days(6 days but a holiday day friday 1 november saturday and sunday  monday 4 there was DANA alert I did not went back to the register office asking for the justificante)   till this day I haven't gotten a reply from the email I sent. 
on tuesday 5 I inquiry again this time on workplace chat mr Bejot how should I proceed insisting that I didn't get the justificante from the register office but I had the oath certifcate that i is a quite valid document that proves I was the the register office that day, 
and I kept insisting for the rest of the days that the oath certificated was valid proof and every time mr bejot  denied with absolut certainty that the document was not vaild. to which I told him to iqury further with other tms or stm to which he replid he would do, bot apparenlty he didn't do it or if it did it wasn't in a propper way
finally on november 7 mr bejot told me I he was going to 'help' me , and he would give me some time of meeting for calling the office and get againg the justificante, while I also suggested I was going to send hime the otah certificated and other doccument attached  to the email, which I did on november 7 at 9:19.
when I returned I told mr bejot I had sent him the email with the oath certificated and I kindly requested to check which obviously he did't do, since it was only days later when I informed him I had gotten a warning, tha he realized that the document we the  according to the same stm it had sanctioned me with the warning. on november 7 mr bejot suggested me to provide the documents trough the platfomr workday after I finished my shift. on november 8 I got the warning for 'not providing the document that proof my attendance to the appointemt' issue by the then senior team managger, Julio Miguel Arenas Arteta the very same stm that along with mr bejot had dismmised the oath of nationality certficaded as valid document and the very sam stm that after issuing the warnig finally checked the document and realized it was a valid document.
after that day we had a meeting where both person very unenthicaly and unproffesionally deny their responsability in the whole situation. I haven't rised the issue till now since I have had my personal issue to address including the death of my father and other procesess related to my newlly aquiry nationality and I decided to prioritize such issue but I want to clarify what happened
